# Pixel Snowboard Sprint

Retro 8-bit styled browser game where you ride a pixelated snowboarder, dodge trees, and chase a new best score. Works on desktop and mobile.

## Play
- Open `index.html` in a browser (or run `python -m http.server` and visit `http://localhost:8000`).
- Desktop: arrows or `A / D` to steer, `Space / W / ↑` to jump, `Space` also starts/restarts.
- Mobile: tap the left/right pads or drag across the screen to lean, tap Jump to hop over trees.

Scores persist locally between runs. Have fun riding the retro ridge!
